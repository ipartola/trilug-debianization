        </ul>

        <h2>Motivation: Why bother with Debian packages</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>8 word version: Gives you a simple way to manage dependencies</li>
            <li>4 word version: Integrates software with system</li>
            <li>2 word version: Easier Ops</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Step 1: Setting up</h2>

            <pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install build-essential devscripts dh-make</code></pre>

        <p>Configure dh_make: add your name and email to your .bashrc:</p>
        <pre><code>$ echo 'DEBEMAIL="example@trilug.org"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'DEBFULLNAME="Example Name"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'export DEBEMAIL DEBFULLNAME' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc</code></pre>

        <h2>Step 2: Preparing your codebase</h2>

        <p>The structure of your source tree should look like this:</p>

<pre>trilug-simple/
    doc/
    src/
    Makefile</pre>

        <p>Note: All the source code is located under the src/ directory, and not in the 
        top level directory. doc/ may contain anything from README's to sample config 
        files. The Makefile should include the <strong>build</strong> and <strong>install</strong> targets so 
        that dpkg can use it to create the Debian package.</p>

        <p>Note: Makefile is not the only way. We will talk about this later.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Debianizing your codebase</h2>

        <p>"Debianizing" your codebase consists of adding a debian/ directory to your 
        project, which will contain the configuration files necessary to create a 
        Debian package. The dh-make package provides a script that will do most of 
        this work for us:</p>

        <pre><code>$ mkdir -p ~/buildroot/ &amp;&amp; cd ~/buildroot/
$ git clone git://github.com/ipartola/trilug-debianization.git ./
$ cd trilug-simple-1.0</code></pre>

        <p>We are now ready to add the debian/ directory. We use the dh_make command to 
        do this. We also give it two hints: first we are telling it that we are going to create a 
        single package. We are also going to tell it 
        that we want to create a "native" package; that is we are not packaging 
        a piece of software that was written by someone else.</p>

        <pre><code>$ dh_make --single --native 
Maintainer name : Example name
Email-Address   : example@trilug.org
Date            : Tue, 25 Jan 2011 11:16:16 -0500
Package Name    : trilug-simple
Version         : 1.0
License         : gpl
Using dpatch    : no
Type of Package : Single
Hit &lt;enter&gt; to confirm: 

$ cd debian/</code></pre>

        <p>We are now ready to begin customizing the configuration files in the 
        debian/ directory. The first step is to remove the templates we are not using.</p>

        <pre><code>$ rm emacsen* manpage* README* watch.ex trilug-simple.doc-base.EX menu.ex</code></pre>
        
        <p>On Debian 5 remove init.d and use init.d.lsb.ex instead:</p>
        
        <pre><code>$ rm init.d.ex &amp;&amp; mv init.d.lsb.ex init.d</code></pre>

        <p>Now let's walk through the rest of the files and what they should contain:</p>

        <h3>changelog</h3>

        <p>The changelog for the project. This file is important: the version of the 
        package will be derived from the top line of this file. Here is an example:</p>

        <pre><code>trilug-simple (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major feature addded
  - Minor feature or bug fix

-- Example Name &lt;example@trilug.org&gt;  Mon, 21 Aug 2011 21:07:16 -0400

trilug-simple (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.

-- Example Name &lt;example@trilug.org&gt;  Tue, 25 Jan 2011 21:06:35 -0400</code></pre>

        <p>The version does not have to be in the x.x format. In fact,
        it is a good idea to use the revision number from your version control system 
        as the package version instead. You should probably also use the commit log 
        from your VCS to automatically populate this file, instead of modifying it 
        directly (that way you would be sure to fill it out).</p>

        <h3>compat</h3>

        <p>This file contains the compatibility level with debhelper (which we use 
        indirectly). This should simply be set to 7.</p>

        <h3>control</h3>

        <p>The control file contains important information about your package such as its 
        name, dependencies (build-time and run-time), and architecture. Here is an 
        example:</p>

<pre><code>Source: trilug-simple
Section: web
Priority: extra
Maintainer: Example Name &lt;example@trilug.org&gt;
Build-Depends: debhelper (&gt;= 7), libcurl4-gnutls-dev
Standards-Version: 3.8.0

Package: trilug-simple
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libcurl3
Description: sample trilug package that does much of nothing
 The simple package is a good way to learn how to create simple debian 
 packages. It is meant as an example, but is by no means exhaustive.</code></pre>

        <p>For sections, see: <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/">http://packages.debian.org/stable/</a></p>

        <p>One important gotcha here is the Architecture clause. It can be <strong>any</strong>, <strong>all</strong> or 
        a specific arch, such as <strong>amd64</strong>. Generally, you want to use either <strong>any</strong> or <strong>all</strong>, 
        where <strong>any</strong> means that the final package will be compiled for a particular 
        architecture, and <strong>all</strong> means that the same package will run on <strong>all</strong> 
        architectures. Generally, anything that's compiled will use <strong>any</strong> while software 
        written in interpreted languages will have Architecture set to <strong>all</strong>.</p>

        <p>Dependencies, recommendations, suggestions and conflicts may be listed here 
        as well. Note that you can even specify version: <em>debhelper (&gt;= 7)</em>.
        You can also  use the Depends clause for your own packages. For example you could have 
        trilug-simple depend on trilug-lib, and then when you run <code>$ apt-get install trilug-simple</code>,
        trilug-lib will be installed automatically.</p>

        <h3>copyright</h3>

        <p>This file is not particularly important, but building the package will not 
        work without it. Here is the sample content for a commerical product
        (I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice):</p>

<pre><code>Format: http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep5
Upstream-Name: trilug-simple

Files: *
Copyright: 2011 Example Name &lt;example@trilug.org&gt;
License: Proprietary

 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED</code></pre>

        <h3>(trilug-simple).cron.d:</h3>

        <p>This is an optional, but often very useful file which will let you define cron 
        jobs that your package will need to run. It will get installed as 
        /etc/cron.d/trilug-simple. If you are going to use this file, make sure to 
        list cron as one of your dependencies.</p>

        <h3>docs</h3>

        <p>This file lists files/directories that will be installed into 
        /usr/share/doc/trilug-simple/. For example:</p>

<pre><code>doc/README
doc/LICENSE</code></pre>

        <h3>init.d</h3>

        <p>This optional file gets installed as /etc/init.d/trilug-simple. This is the 
        standard mechanism for starting up processes on system boot. This file is 
        rather long, and in most cases the sample file is a very good start.</p>

        <p>Note: most daemons do not need to run as root, but that is the default in the 
        sample init.d file. To make sure the process does not run as root you will 
        need to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Make sure a package-specific user exists (we will do this below in preinst)</li>
            <li>Make sure the package-specific user has write access to all the necessary
            directories, such as /var/logs/trilug-simple, /var/run/trilug-simple, 
            /var/lib/trilug-simple, etc. This is best done in the start function of 
            the init script.</li>
            <li>Make sure to tell start-stop-daemon command that we want to run as a 
            specific user using the <em>--chuid</em> parameter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>preinst, postinst, prerm and postrm</h3>

        <p>These files will be run before and after the package is installed and removed, 
        respectively. If one of these files is not present, a default one will be 
        generated. What each file should include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>preinst - creating package-specific users</li>
            <li>postinst - installing the init script to the appropriate runlevels and 
            starting up the daemons</li>
            <li>prerm - stopping the daemons</li>
            <li>postrm - removing the package-specific users, removing init script from all runlevels</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>rules</h3>

        <p>This file is an executable Makefile (separate from the one that comes with 
        your codebase). It allows you to have a great deal of customization for how 
        your package is built (see 
        <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dreq.en.html#rules">Debian New Maintainers' Guide</a>
        for details). However, there is a shortcut:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/make -f
# -*- makefile -*-
# Sample debian/rules that uses debhelper.
# This file was originally written by Joey Hess and Craig Small.
# As a special exception, when this file is copied by dh-make into a
# dh-make output file, you may use that output file without restriction.
# This special exception was added by Craig Small in version 0.37 of dh-make.

# Uncomment this to turn on verbose mode.
#export DH_VERBOSE=1

%:
        dh $@
</code></pre>

        <p>The above file will run all the default rules, which will use our 
        trilug-simple/Makefile to do the building, installation, cleanup, etc.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Building the package</h2>

        <p>Building the package is a simple matter of using the debuild(1) command:</p>

        <pre><code>$ debuild -us -uc</code></pre>

        <p>This command produces a lot of output that includes the result of building 
        your source and the output of Lintian.</p>

        <p>Lintian is a program that finds packaging errors in your Debian packages. It
        can be very helpful in debugging errors in your packages, and can help catch
        some bugs that you would not normally see. It produces warnings like: 
        possibly-insecure-handling-of-tmp-files-in-maintainer-script postrm:25. You 
        can search the <a href="http://lintian.debian.org/">Lintian website</a> for the
        meaning of these messages, which should help you fix them.</p>

        <p>Note: If you want to remove all the temporary files that debuild created run: <code>$ debuild clean</code></p>

        <h2>Lyrical aside: Python packages</h2>

        <p>A lot of software is written in languages other than C. Python is one popular
        choice. Debian supports Python-based packages through the python-support 
        framework. There are a few things that are different:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>You can use a setup.py file (using setuptools) instead of a Makefile. The magic 
            shortcut in the debian/rules file will automatically detect this.</li>

            <li>Starting a Python-based daemon is different, since the name of the 
            executable is going to be something like <code>/usr/bin/python</code> instead of the name
            you gave it. Adjust your init.d file accordingly.</li>

            <li>Python is a semi-compiled language. Installing the source does not mean 
            that you can import it. Test using <code>"import trilug.hello"</code> from the Python 
            interpreter. To make sure this works run 
            <code>`update-python-modules trilug-python`</code> in the postinst script and before 
            you start the daemon in the init.d file.</li>

            <li>You should include <em>python-support</em> and <em>python</em> as dependencies in your control
            file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 4: Setting up a repository</h2>

        <p>After your software is built, you will want to set up an APT repository so all
        of your servers can install the packages via the normal apt-get/aptitude 
        command.</p>

        <p>An APT repository is simply a web service which hosts the .deb files, a GPG 
        signature and a package list file. We want this repository to be secure from
        unauthorized access if we host it on the internet. To do this, we will use 
        HTTP Basic Auth and only allow access to our repository over HTTPS.</p>

        <p>Note: for the sake of brevity, we are skipping the SSL/TLS setup.</p>

        <p>First let's get nginx set up:</p>

            <pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install nginx apache2-utils apt-utils</code></pre>

        <p>Update the /etc/nginx/sites-available/default:</p>

<pre><code>server {
    listen   [::]:80;
    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        root /var/www;
        autoindex on;
        auth_basic "Restricted";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/apt-htpasswd;
    }
}</code></pre>

        <p>Add a Basic Auth user, using trilug as password:</p>

            <pre><code>$ sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/apt-htpasswd testuser</code></pre>

        <p>Create a location where the repository will live:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
$ mkdir -p /var/www/testing
$ mkdir -p /var/www/stable</code></pre>

        <p>We also need to create an /etc/apt/apt-release.conf file:</p>

<pre><code>APT::FTPArchive::Release::Origin "trilug";
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Label "trilug";
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Suite "custom";
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Codename "custom";
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Architectures "amd64 i386 source any all";
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Components "main";
APT::FTPArchive::Release::Description "Custom debian packages for TriLUG.";</code></pre>

        <p>Create an exectuable file /usr/local/bin/update-apt-repo:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: update-apt-repo path [gpg_key_id]"
    exit -1
fi

REPO_PATH=$1
KEY=$2

if [ -n $KEY ]; then
    KEY_COMMAND="--default-key $KEY"
fi

cd $REPO_PATH;

apt-ftparchive packages . &gt; Packages
cat Packages | gzip -c9 &gt; Packages.gz
apt-ftparchive -c /etc/apt/apt-release.conf release . &gt; ./Release
rm -rf Release.gpg
gpg --armor --detach-sign --sign $KEY_COMMAND --output Release.gpg Release
</code></pre>

        <p>This file will be run with two parameters: the path to the APT repository and 
        the name of GPG key which will be used to sign the Release file.</p>

        <p>Let's add the user and create the GPG key:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo useradd -m repomaster
$ sudo chown -R repomaster:repomaster /var/www
$ sudo su repomaster
$ gpg --gen-key</code></pre>

        <p>Make sure to use a blank passphrase for the last step. After answering all the
        questions GPG asks, figure out what key to use:</p>

<pre><code>$ gpg --list-keys
/home/repomaster/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
-----------------------------------
pub   2048R/29DDDFA8 2011-09-05
uid                  Repo Master &lt;repomaster@trilug.org&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>The key name is <strong>29DDDFA8</strong>. Now let's run the update-apt-repo script we wrote 
        to test it:</p>

<pre><code>$ cp /home/YOURUSER/buildroot/trilug-simple/*.deb /var/www/testing/
$ update-apt-repo /var/www/testing 29DDDFA8
$ ls /var/www/testing
Packages  Packages.gz  Release  Release.gpg  trilug-simple_1.0_amd64.deb</code></pre>

        <p>If you look in the Packages file, you will find that our package is listed
        there.</p>

        <p>We also need to export the GPG public key so that apt-get/aptitude know to 
        trust our repository lists:</p>

<pre><code>$ gpg --export &gt; /var/www/public.key</code></pre>

        <p>As a final step, let's make sure that the update-apt-repo script 
        runs automatically. To do so, simply add the following to your /etc/crontab
        file:</p>

<pre><code>* * * * * repomaster /usr/bin/update-apt-repo /var/www/apt/stable 29DDDFA8
* * * * * repomaster /usr/bin/update-apt-repo /var/www/apt/testing 29DDDFA8</code></pre>

        <h2>Step 5: Adding repositories to your machines and using them</h2>

        <p>HTTPS support is not available by default on older Debian distributions. To 
        fix this we run:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https</code></pre>

        <p>Now, let's add our repository to /etc/apt/sources.list file:</p>

<pre><code>deb http://testuser:trilug@localhost:80/testing /</code></pre>

        <p>We also need to tell APT that it can trust this repository. This is done by
        importing the repomaster's public key:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl http://testuser:trilug@localhost/public.key | sudo apt-key add -</code></pre>

        <p>Note: if you are going to use a self-signed SSL certificate, make sure to add
        it to the list of trusted certificates on all your machines.</p>

        <p>Now, we are ready to use the repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
$ apt-cache search trilug
trilug-simple - TriLUG greeter
$ sudo apt-get install trilug-simple</code></pre>

        <h2>Lyrical aside #2: Your build process</h2>

        <p>The process of "debianizing" your software is a one-time investment. However,
        you will end up building it frequently. Things you may want to consider to make
        it easier on yourself:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If you are using a compiled language and the result is arch-dependent, set 
            up a different build machine for each architecture (e.g.: amd64, i386, etc).</li>

            <li>Write a build script that pulls changelog data from your VCS, updates 
            debian/changelog, runs debuild on all your build hosts, uploads to your repo.</li>

            <li>Have your build script run automated tests before debuild is run.</li>

            <li>Have your VCS system trigger a build each time a developer creates a new tag.</li>
        </ul>
